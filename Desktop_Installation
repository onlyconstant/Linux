Important note:
    Manjaro:

    Antergos:
        1. after default installation of Antergos, I cannot use dvorak keyboard in login page.
            according to one answer from internet, delete dvorak, add English, delete English, add dvorak will fix this.
        2. during one boot, antergos login page went dart and come back time and time, I have to restart computer.

    ElementaryOS:

    OpenSuse:
        1. yast is a powerful tool not only for software updating.

    Gentoo:
        1. after gentoo installation, network interface was not brought up.
            lspci shows no kernel module loaded for the nic.
            update kernel configuration, remove all other nic driver except RTL8169
            re-compile kernel and driver properly loaded.
            I can save current version of kernel configuration for future gentoo installation for desktop computer.
        2. I select "desktop" profile when installing gentoo, I am not sure what else I still need to have awesome wm.
        3. xorg-server, awesome installed, and put "exec awesome" in ~/.xinitrc file to start awesome with startx.
            To enable xorg-server / awesome, refer to https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Guide, it will tell
            how-to kernel setting, how-to graphic card driver select, how-to xorg-server installation, etc.
        4. backup kernel config file for future use (done).


    Parrot:
        1. apt-get update may report failure in downloading some packages, add --fix-missing parameter will fix it.
